## What is this?

This is a garbage dump where I test CI/CD and container configs (primarily Docker for now). I'm storing working configs here so I can do `cp lol.yml ~/Repos/libkoolthing/.github/workflows/rust.yml`.

Honestly, I likely copied anything related to GitHub actions from [Luca Palmieri](https://www.lpalmieri.com/)'s books or [sniffnet](https://github.com/GyulyVGC/sniffnet/)'s pipeline.
